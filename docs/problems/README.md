## The Problem

Being successful at communication is hard. Not only are there now hundreds of
communication mediums to chose from, they all introduce their own concepts of
conveying context-specific information.

Think about the last conversation you had before reading this document. Was it
face-to-face?  On a phone without seeing the opposite? Through a instant
messenger? Or maybe, was it you writing a GitHub issue?

When having that f2f, did you look the other person in the eyes? What was their
facial impression while talking and listening? How were they dressed? How did
they react to statements and particular words? Where did they position
themselves in the room? What was the exact sequence of words they said? What
questions did they ask?

And when talking on the phone, did you examine the opponents voice? Did one of
you had to repeat themselves because the connection dropped? What language(s)
did the two of you use? Did one of you use the phrase: "I'll send you a email
about that later"? In your opinion, what was the opponents mood before and
after your conversation. And, are you convinced to have gotten your point
across?

You might also ask yourself: Should I send this email? This text? Should I
sleep over it? What words am I using? May they offend someone? How do I write a
neutral GitHub issue; or do I even care about being neutral? What if I _need_
this particular feature for the project I'm working on? Does it fit the
roadmap? The vision, the bigger picture?

And more ironically, you might ask yourself right now: "Why is a stupid `.md`
file asking me all these hard questions?" and, "how can I file a pull request
to remove it?". Maybe most importantly: "_Who_ wrote this???". Assuming the
reader's convictions, the author(s) urges the reader to read on.

Communication is a problem. Conveying of information is a problem. Agreeing on
problems is a problem. And, since developing software relies on communicating
how to develop software, software development is a problem.

## The Assumed Solution

[Peter Hintjens conviction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFVDNTXIC_Y)was
that unidentified assumptions and contexts are _a_ root cause of communication
failing. _Assuming_ they are, Peter outlines a solution as following:

1. All issues describe problems
1. Problem descriptions do not suggest solutions. They don't contain or hide
assumptions
1. Problems have relative relevancy
1. Problems can be challenged
1. Problems can be solved in many different ways. The best solutions will
ultimately stand-out
1. Assuming assumption-lacking problem identification leads to successful
communication patters, leading to the identification of the right solutions
that lead to successful software development and hence ultimately to successful
software.

Given this _assumed solution_, the author(s)'d like to invite you to take part
in this experiment.

### How?

Take a look at this document and it's structure. Take a look at the folder and
it's other documents. check their structure, their syntactic and semantic
properties. think about how _you_'d like to contribute to this folder of
documents.  does it have problems itself? If so, what are they?  Then think
about how to fix them. Or let others fix them for you.
